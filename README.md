# LUSFiber Smart City Challenge

This is a python script that pulls down 100 frames from each of the cameras at each Ambassador Caffrey intersection in Lafayette, Louisiana from the Lafayette Consolidated Government website. "Image Not Available" frames from broken feed are then pruned by comparing RGB data using PIL image tools.
